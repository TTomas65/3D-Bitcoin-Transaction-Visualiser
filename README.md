## Features

- üåê Real-time transaction monitoring through blockchain.info WebSocket API
- üí∞ Live Bitcoin price updates from CoinDesk API
- üé® Dynamic sphere colors and sizes based on transaction amounts
- üìä Transaction history with detailed information
- üé• 3D visualization with physics simulation
- ‚ö° Built with modern React and Three.js

## Color Coding

Transaction spheres are color-coded based on their BTC amount:
- White: 0.5 BTC
- Yellow: 1 BTC
- Purple: 2.5 BTC
- Blue: 5 BTC
- Green: 10 BTC
- Orange: 25 BTC
- Gold: 50 BTC
- Red: 100 BTC
